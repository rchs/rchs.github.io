### Personal Traits

 - **You can get shit done!!**
 If intrinsically your first response is “Yo Garne!!” rather than “K Garne?”, we are already in love with you.  
  
- **You can see through fluff and bullshit.**
No matter how complicated the mess, how long the feature list, anPersonal Traitsd how dirty the data, you understand that a little thought can bring about massive amount of clarity. And you have mastered the art of doing more with less and the ability to see the future by focusing on things that actually matter.  
  
- **Your only true love are the Users.**
Nothing comes between you and your urge to create happy users; not ridiculous complaints from users, not your need to be right, and most definitely not your ego or pet feature.  
  
- **You my friend are infectious as eff.**
People around you naturally want to be better than they were yesterday. And if they don’t, you know how to make sure they do. ;)

### Responsibilities
- **Team Management**
You will manage a team of designers, developers and marketers. You job will not just bring peace into that mix, but create synergy between these oftentimes conflicting groups. You will oversee a maximum of 2 products at a time.  
  
- **Oversee Product Definition**
All products are assumptions. But some assumptions are better than others. You will be responsible for picking out winners through insight, user research, voodoo, and black magic. And then, you will oversee the design of those ‘winners’.  
  
- **Oversee Product Development**
This is the meat of your work responsibility. While, you might be a dabbler in the three other areas, you need to be an expert at this. You should know how to balance scalability with feature cuts, deadlines with documentation, and meetings with coding. :)  

- **Oversee Product Iteration**
Most products fail. As Mike Tyson said, “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” The key is to know why you got punched and make sure you duck next time. Enter Analytics, Reporting and Iterations.
