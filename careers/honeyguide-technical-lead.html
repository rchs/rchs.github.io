                  <li>
                    <strong>Analyze Key Metrics with the Product Manager.</strong>
                    <p>We work on a Build-Measure-Learn philosophy, and metrics are how we decide what to build.</p>

                    <strong>Brainstorm Ideas to Increase Conversion Rate</strong>
                    <p>Once you understand where the room for improvement is, you will coordinate with the product manager to come up with interventions to increase the conversion rate.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Make sure that all Live Products are working correctly.</strong>
                    <p>Hacks, DDoS, Downtime, Crashes. You will, of course, be on top of all these undesirable elements. :). You should be able to work with AWS technology stack (Cache / Database / Load Balancer/) and Github actions to automate and scale our applications with zero human intervention. Make sure we do not get '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Capital_Group">Knightmare</a>.'</p>

                    <strong>Build the Backend</strong>
                    <p>You will coordinate with Roaches Technology Lead to create the system architecture, database design & optimizations and implement the backend code whenever and wherever required.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Oversee the overall Code Quality of the Products</strong>
                    <p>You will coordinate with the Product Managers to assess the quality of the frontend and backend implementations, especially with regards to the quality of the code. No code will see the light of day without your approval. You will be responsible for every milliWatt Hour wasted on our mobile apps, for every unnecessary click, additional latency from the server, and redundant AWS instances.</p>
