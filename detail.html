              but profitable products from start to finish. Have an idea for one, but can’t seem to find theteam with

                <h3>Personal Traits</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>You can get shit done!!</strong>
                    <p>If intrinsically your first response is “Yo Garne!!” rather than “K Garne?”, we are already in
                      love with you.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>You can see through fluff and bullshit.</strong>
                    <p>No matter how complicated the mess, how long the feature list, anPersonal Traitsd how dirty the
                      data, you understand that a little thought can bring about massive amount of clarity. And you have
                      mastered the art of doing more with less and the ability to see the future by focusing on things
                      that actually matter.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Your only true love are the Users.</strong>
                    <p>Nothing comes between you and your urge to create happy users; not ridiculous complaints from
                      users, not your need to be right, and most definitely not your ego or pet feature.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>You my friend are infectious as eff.</strong>
                    <p>People around you naturally want to be better than they were yesterday. And if they don’t, you
                      know how to make sure they do. ;)</p>
                  </li>

                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Team Management</strong>
                    <p>You will manage a team of designers, developers and marketers. You job will not just bring peace
                      into that mix, but create synergy between these oftentimes conflicting groups. You will oversee a
                      maximum of 2 products at a time. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Oversee Product Definition</strong>
                    <p>All products are assumptions. But some assumptions are better than others. You will be
                      responsible for picking out winners through insight, user research, voodoo, and black magic. And
                      then, you will oversee the design of those ‘winners’.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Oversee Product Development</strong>
                    <p>This is the meat of your work responsibility. While, you might be a dabbler in the three other
                      areas, you need to be an expert at this. You should know how to balance scalability with feature
                      cuts, deadlines with documentation, and meetings with coding. :)</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Oversee Product Iteration</strong>
                    <p>Most products fail. As Mike Tyson said, “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the
                      face.” The key is to know why you got punched and make sure you duck next time. Enter Analytics,
                      Reporting and Iterations.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Experience with Programming open to work with any platform. If you know Javascript and React, that
                    would be an icing on the cake. </li>
                  <li>Knowledge of Testing Frameworks and CI/CD work flows.</li>

                  <li>Some experience with Recruiting, Performance Appraisals, and Mentoring.</li>
                  <li>Good understanding of UI/UX Concepts is needed. Experience with Design tools not necessary but
